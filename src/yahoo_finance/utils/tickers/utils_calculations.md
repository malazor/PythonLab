log_ret = UtilsCalculations.log_return(120, 100)

# Annualized return from monthly return
annual_ret = UtilsCalculations.annualize_return_from_monthly(0.02)

# Annualized volatility from weekly volatility
annual_vol = UtilsCalculations.annualize_volatility_from_weekly(0.015)

# CAGR calculation
cagr = UtilsCalculations.compound_annual_growth_rate(final_value=1800, initial_value=1000, periods=5)
```
